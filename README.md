A Redmine plugin that enables quick access to Redmine objects and macros via trigger characters, contextual autocomplete, and an inline selection menu in any text field.

> Built for teams who write a lot of Redmine text and want fast, discoverable links without remembering syntax.

## Features

- **`>>` — Smart Linker**: A cascading popover to build links to any internal objects without knowing the syntax:
  - **Hierarchical Drill-Down**: Seamlessly drill down from projects/subprojects $\rightarrow$ sections (Issues, Wiki, News, Files, etc.) $\rightarrow$ target items or wiki anchors.
  - **Wiki, News, Documents & Files Integration**: Browse, search, and link wiki headings/anchors, news articles, documents, and project files with automatic, native Redmine/Markdown syntax formatting.
  - **Tab-Triggered Link Editing**: Place caret cursor on any link (Markdown, Textile, Double Brackets, raw attachments/issues) and press `Tab` to instantly reopen the Smart Linker cascaded at that exact item!
  - **Third-Party Addon Support**: Automatically scrapes active Redmine `#main-menu` links on load to dynamically register and link third-party tabs (like DMSF, Questions, Checklists, etc.) in the subpages menu.
- **`{{` — Macro Autocomplete**: Type `{{` to get a dropdown of all available Redmine macros with descriptions and a full detail preview panel.
- **`@` — Instant Mention Dropdown**: Shows up immediately after `@` (no minimum character required) for extremely fast user tagging.

All features work in **every wiki text area**: wiki pages, issue descriptions, issue notes, journal edits, news comments, forum messages, and project/document descriptions.

## Requirements

- Redmine 5.0 or higher

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The plugin directory **MUST** be named `redmine_subtrigger` for the hook to load correctly.

1. **Clone** into your plugins directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/redmine/plugins
   git clone https://github.com/subversive-tools/redmine_subtrigger.git redmine_subtrigger
   ```

2. **Restart Redmine** (no migrations required).

## Usage

### `>>` — Smart Linker

Type `>>` after a space or at the start of a line. An ultra-compact multi-column panel opens, showing one active navigation column at a time (width 280px) and following your cursor.

You can either navigate options visually (using arrow keys or your mouse cursor) or type text to filter options in real-time and press `Tab`/`Enter` to autocomplete and drill down.

#### Intermediate Level Navigation

- **ArrowUp / ArrowDown**: Navigate through list items in the active column.
- **Tab / Enter / ArrowRight (`→`)**: Expand the highlighted intermediate item (project or subpage branch), appending a `>` delimiter (e.g. `>>myproject>Tickets>`) and cascading to the next adjacent column.
- **Escape (`Esc`) / ArrowLeft (`←`) / Shift+Tab**: Backtrack one column level to the left, safely reverting the path and restoring the highlighted parent selection without closing the panel.

#### Wiki Anchors, News, Documents & Files

- **Wiki Anchors**: Typing `#` after a Wiki page name or highlighting a page in Column 3 and pressing `Tab` triggers autocomplete for the page's headings.
- **News, Documents, Files etc**: Integrates project news (with comment counts), documents (crawled dynamically), and files (via JSON API) for instant lookup and linking.

#### Dynamic Third-Party Addons

The Smart Linker dynamically crawls the `#main-menu` navigation on load. Any third-party Redmine addon tab (e.g., DMSF, Questions, Checklists, etc.) will automatically appear as an option in the subpage list and can be searched and linked directly.

#### Link Editing

If the caret is inside any Markdown link, Textile link, double-bracket wiki link (`[[Page]]`), attachment shorthand (`attachment:file.ext`), or issue shorthand (`#123` or `project#123`), pressing `Tab` will trigger the Smart Linker.

### `{{` — Macro Autocomplete

Type `{{` anywhere in a wiki text area. A dropdown appears listing all available macros with a short description. Use arrow keys to navigate, `Tab` or `Enter` to insert.

The detail panel below the list shows the full macro description for the currently selected entry.

### `@` — Instant Mention

Type `@` at the start of a word. The member dropdown opens immediately (unlike Redmine's default which requires at least one character). Type to filter; only the first 10 members are shown.

## Configuration

Administrators can configure the plugin under **Administration -> Plugins -> Subtrigger (Configure)**:
- **Toggle Features**: Independently enable/disable macro autocomplete (`{{`), mention autocomplete patch (`@`), or the Smart Linker (`>>`).
- **Custom Trigger**: Customize the trigger characters for the Smart Linker (default is `>>`, but can be set to any other key).

## How It Works

The plugin injects a single `<style>` and `<script>` block into every Redmine page via a `ViewListener` hook. No external dependencies or bloated JavaScript frameworks. All assets are read from disk on each request, making browser reload sufficient after updating plugin files.

The project list is prefetched 2 seconds after page load so the Smart Linker panel opens instantly.
